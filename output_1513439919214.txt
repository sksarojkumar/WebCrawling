Developers can use cabinet creation tools such as Makecab.exe and Cabarc.exe to create cabinet files for use with a software installer. Large files can be spanned across multiple cabinets, but each cabinet can have a maximum of 15 files that span to a second cabinet file. The installation utility, such as Windows Installer, extracts the files in the same order they are stored in the cabinet file. Important: CAB files may be located inside or outside of an .MSI file. About Microsoft Windows Installer Windows Installer is a utility included with the Windows operating system for installing applications. It extracts files from installer packages and copies them to the locations defined by the installer. The program can be used to install Microsoft software as well as third-party applications. Windows Installer can also be used to remove software that has been previously installed.

	(File Type: Data File) :: A DAT file is a generic data file. It contains data that may be opened or referenced by a specific application. While some DAT files can be opened directly, most contain program data that is referenced the program when it is running. Therefore, most DAT files are not meant to be opened manually. Since ".dat" is a generic extension, it may be used by multiple programs. This can make it difficult to know how to open a DAT file. However, if the DAT file is saved in a text format, you can view the contents of the file by opening it in a text editor.
	(File Type: VCD Video File) :: A DAT file may also be a video file from a Video CD, or VCD disc. DAT files are typically found in the \MPEGAV\ directory of VCD disks and contain MPEG video data. They can be opened directly by supporting video playback programs.
	(File Type: Exchange E-mail Attachment) :: Files named Winmail.dat contain formatting information for Rich Text (.RTF) messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange Server. A Winmail.dat file may be appended to the end of an e-mail when the recipient's e-mail client does not support RTF-formatted messages.

	(File Type: Graphical Interchange Format File) :: Referenced by an application; not meant to be opened manually; may run a program or script when opened

Description	:	
	(File Type: Graphical Interchange Format File) :: GIF files are saved in a compressed, indexed-color format and are commonly used for Web graphics. They use lossless compression, which means they do not lose any quality when compressed. The GIF format supports up to 256 colors (including transparent pixels), which may be predefined or selected by the user. GIFs can also be animated, making them popular choices for buttons and other small Web graphics. However, since GIF images can only contain 256 colors, they are not ideal for digital photographs. This is why most digital photos are saved as .JPG files.

This mechanism provides advantages for system administration and also allows users to access critical business applications, or "enterprise applications," from remote locations. ICA files can be created with the ICA File Creator program or a basic text editor. Important: You can double-click an ICA file to open the remote virtual application or desktop environment referenced by the file. But, note that you must have a Citrix client installed in order for the file to open properly. A common client is the Citrix Receiver, a desktop application and Web browser plug-in that runs the hosted applications and desktops within a Web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Citrix Receiver replaced the former "Citrix Online Plug-in" for Mac and Windows.

Description	:	
	(File Type: JPEG Image) :: JPEG image files are commonly used for Web graphics and are produced by nearly all digital cameras. They are saved in a compressed format that supports millions of colors, making them ideal for digital photographs. The JPEG format uses lossy compression, which means the quality of the image is reduced as the compression is increased. However, unless high amounts of compression are used, the quality loss is typically not noticeable. Since JPEG is a ubiquitous file format, JPG images can be viewed in all Web browsers and in most image-editing programs.

The files are "zipped" into a single archive that takes up minimal space using a file compression algorithm. In order to open the file(s) in the archive, they must be decompressed or "unzipped" with a file decompression utility. Both Macintosh and Windows computers have built-in zip utilities that can zip and unzip files, but several third-party options are also available. About Corel WinZip WinZip is a popular file compression utility for Windows. It can be used to compress and decompress file archives in many different formats and can create split archives. WinZip supports the "ZIPX" format and also supports image compression. The program can also encrypt files with AES encryption to protect sensitive data.

Description	:	
	(File Type: Data File) :: A DAT file is a generic data file. It contains data that may be opened or referenced by a specific application. While some DAT files can be opened directly, most contain program data that is referenced the program when it is running. Therefore, most DAT files are not meant to be opened manually. Since ".dat" is a generic extension, it may be used by multiple programs. This can make it difficult to know how to open a DAT file. However, if the DAT file is saved in a text format, you can view the contents of the file by opening it in a text editor.
	(File Type: VCD Video File) :: A DAT file may also be a video file from a Video CD, or VCD disc. DAT files are typically found in the \MPEGAV\ directory of VCD disks and contain MPEG video data. They can be opened directly by supporting video playback programs.
	(File Type: Exchange E-mail Attachment) :: Files named Winmail.dat contain formatting information for Rich Text (.RTF) messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange Server. A Winmail.dat file may be appended to the end of an e-mail when the recipient's e-mail client does not support RTF-formatted messages.

Description	:	
	(File Type: Windows Cabinet File) :: A cabinet file stores multiple compressed files in a library. It is an efficient way to package data and is often used for creating software installation archives. Examples of installers that use cabinet files include device drivers, software updates, and network components. Developers can use cabinet creation tools such as Makecab.exe and Cabarc.exe to create cabinet files for use with a software installer. Large files can be spanned across multiple cabinets, but each cabinet can have a maximum of 15 files that span to a second cabinet file. The installation utility, such as Windows Installer, extracts the files in the same order they are stored in the cabinet file. Important: CAB files may be located inside or outside of an .MSI file. About Microsoft Windows Installer Windows Installer is a utility included with the Windows operating system for installing applications. It extracts files from installer packages and copies them to the locations defined by the installer. The program can be used to install Microsoft software as well as third-party applications. Windows Installer can also be used to remove software that has been previously installed.

Description	:	
	(File Type: Data File) :: A DAT file is a generic data file. It contains data that may be opened or referenced by a specific application. While some DAT files can be opened directly, most contain program data that is referenced the program when it is running. Therefore, most DAT files are not meant to be opened manually. Since ".dat" is a generic extension, it may be used by multiple programs. This can make it difficult to know how to open a DAT file. However, if the DAT file is saved in a text format, you can view the contents of the file by opening it in a text editor.
	(File Type: VCD Video File) :: A DAT file may also be a video file from a Video CD, or VCD disc. DAT files are typically found in the \MPEGAV\ directory of VCD disks and contain MPEG video data. They can be opened directly by supporting video playback programs.
	(File Type: Exchange E-mail Attachment) :: Files named Winmail.dat contain formatting information for Rich Text (.RTF) messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange Server. A Winmail.dat file may be appended to the end of an e-mail when the recipient's e-mail client does not support RTF-formatted messages.

	(File Type: Citrix ICA File) :: Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) file used by Citrix application servers; contains configuration information for connecting to different servers; may link to a published application or to a server desktop environment. ICA files allow users to connect to remote virtual desktops so the user's computer does not need the applications to be installed locally. This mechanism provides advantages for system administration and also allows users to access critical business applications, or "enterprise applications," from remote locations. ICA files can be created with the ICA File Creator program or a basic text editor. Important: You can double-click an ICA file to open the remote virtual application or desktop environment referenced by the file. But, note that you must have a Citrix client installed in order for the file to open properly. A common client is the Citrix Receiver, a desktop application and Web browser plug-in that runs the hosted applications and desktops within a Web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Citrix Receiver replaced the former "Citrix Online Plug-in" for Mac and Windows.

Description	:	
	(File Type: XML File) :: An XML file contains text formatted in XML, the Extensible Markup Language. It contains tags, which define the markup code, and content, which is placed between each set of tags. XML is "extensible" because it supports user-defined elements. This means any type of information can be stored within an XML file. Since XML offers a wide range of flexibility, many programs use XML files to save data. While various programs may use XML files for different purposes, all XML files are saved in a plain text format, which means they can be opened in a basic text editor.

Description	:	
	(File Type: C/C++ Source Code File) :: Source code for a C or C++ program; may include an entire program's source code, or may be one of may source files referenced within a programming project; can be edited using a basic text editor, but will not show syntax highlighting like most software development programs do. C++ is the programming language used for creating many of today's software programs. Some Unix compilers use a lowercase ".c" extension for C and an upper case ".C" extension for C++, although this convention is not common.
	(File Type: Lite-C Script) :: Scripts created with lite-C also use the ".c" extension. They contain code written in the lite-C programming language and are compiled on-the-fly by the lite-C compiler. Lite-C was developed by Conitec Datasystems in cooperation with Atari. It allows users to develop 2D and 3D applications without previous programming knowledge. Many functions, images, and sounds are included with lite-C, which allows for streamlined programming. This makes lite-C an ideal solution for creating casual games and for teaching programming concepts.

Description	:	
	(File Type: Windows Cabinet File) :: A cabinet file stores multiple compressed files in a library. It is an efficient way to package data and is often used for creating software installation archives. Examples of installers that use cabinet files include device drivers, software updates, and network components. Developers can use cabinet creation tools such as Makecab.exe and Cabarc.exe to create cabinet files for use with a software installer. Large files can be spanned across multiple cabinets, but each cabinet can have a maximum of 15 files that span to a second cabinet file. The installation utility, such as Windows Installer, extracts the files in the same order they are stored in the cabinet file. Important: CAB files may be located inside or outside of an .MSI file. About Microsoft Windows Installer Windows Installer is a utility included with the Windows operating system for installing applications. It extracts files from installer packages and copies them to the locations defined by the installer. The program can be used to install Microsoft software as well as third-party applications. Windows Installer can also be used to remove software that has been previously installed.

It can be read on a PC using ebook software or on an e-reader, such as the Barnes and Noble Nook, or Sony Reader. EPUB files are saved in a compressed format that includes multiple XML files. These files define both the structure of the book, as well as the content. The current EPUB standard is developed and maintained by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Important: While EPUB files are saved in an open format, many downloaded books include DRM protection, which limits the devices on which the book can be viewed. Therefore, if you cannot open an EPUB file on computer or e-reader, the device may not be authorized to view the ebook.

	(File Type: Citrix ICA File) :: Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) file used by Citrix application servers; contains configuration information for connecting to different servers; may link to a published application or to a server desktop environment. ICA files allow users to connect to remote virtual desktops so the user's computer does not need the applications to be installed locally. This mechanism provides advantages for system administration and also allows users to access critical business applications, or "enterprise applications," from remote locations. ICA files can be created with the ICA File Creator program or a basic text editor. Important: You can double-click an ICA file to open the remote virtual application or desktop environment referenced by the file. But, note that you must have a Citrix client installed in order for the file to open properly. A common client is the Citrix Receiver, a desktop application and Web browser plug-in that runs the hosted applications and desktops within a Web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Citrix Receiver replaced the former "Citrix Online Plug-in" for Mac and Windows.

Description	:	
	(File Type: Data File) :: A DAT file is a generic data file. It contains data that may be opened or referenced by a specific application. While some DAT files can be opened directly, most contain program data that is referenced the program when it is running. Therefore, most DAT files are not meant to be opened manually. Since ".dat" is a generic extension, it may be used by multiple programs. This can make it difficult to know how to open a DAT file. However, if the DAT file is saved in a text format, you can view the contents of the file by opening it in a text editor.
	(File Type: VCD Video File) :: A DAT file may also be a video file from a Video CD, or VCD disc. DAT files are typically found in the \MPEGAV\ directory of VCD disks and contain MPEG video data. They can be opened directly by supporting video playback programs.
	(File Type: Exchange E-mail Attachment) :: Files named Winmail.dat contain formatting information for Rich Text (.RTF) messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange Server. A Winmail.dat file may be appended to the end of an e-mail when the recipient's e-mail client does not support RTF-formatted messages.

They use lossless compression, which means they do not lose any quality when compressed. The GIF format supports up to 256 colors (including transparent pixels), which may be predefined or selected by the user. GIFs can also be animated, making them popular choices for buttons and other small Web graphics. However, since GIF images can only contain 256 colors, they are not ideal for digital photographs. This is why most digital photos are saved as .JPG files.

ICA files allow users to connect to remote virtual desktops so the user's computer does not need the applications to be installed locally. This mechanism provides advantages for system administration and also allows users to access critical business applications, or "enterprise applications," from remote locations. ICA files can be created with the ICA File Creator program or a basic text editor. Important: You can double-click an ICA file to open the remote virtual application or desktop environment referenced by the file. But, note that you must have a Citrix client installed in order for the file to open properly. A common client is the Citrix Receiver, a desktop application and Web browser plug-in that runs the hosted applications and desktops within a Web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Citrix Receiver replaced the former "Citrix Online Plug-in" for Mac and Windows.

	(File Type: Data File) :: A DAT file is a generic data file. It contains data that may be opened or referenced by a specific application. While some DAT files can be opened directly, most contain program data that is referenced the program when it is running. Therefore, most DAT files are not meant to be opened manually. Since ".dat" is a generic extension, it may be used by multiple programs. This can make it difficult to know how to open a DAT file. However, if the DAT file is saved in a text format, you can view the contents of the file by opening it in a text editor.
	(File Type: VCD Video File) :: A DAT file may also be a video file from a Video CD, or VCD disc. DAT files are typically found in the \MPEGAV\ directory of VCD disks and contain MPEG video data. They can be opened directly by supporting video playback programs.

	(File Type: Citrix ICA File) :: Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) file used by Citrix application servers; contains configuration information for connecting to different servers; may link to a published application or to a server desktop environment. ICA files allow users to connect to remote virtual desktops so the user's computer does not need the applications to be installed locally. This mechanism provides advantages for system administration and also allows users to access critical business applications, or "enterprise applications," from remote locations. ICA files can be created with the ICA File Creator program or a basic text editor. Important: You can double-click an ICA file to open the remote virtual application or desktop environment referenced by the file. But, note that you must have a Citrix client installed in order for the file to open properly. A common client is the Citrix Receiver, a desktop application and Web browser plug-in that runs the hosted applications and desktops within a Web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Citrix Receiver replaced the former "Citrix Online Plug-in" for Mac and Windows.

Large files can be spanned across multiple cabinets, but each cabinet can have a maximum of 15 files that span to a second cabinet file. The installation utility, such as Windows Installer, extracts the files in the same order they are stored in the cabinet file. Important: CAB files may be located inside or outside of an .MSI file. About Microsoft Windows Installer Windows Installer is a utility included with the Windows operating system for installing applications. It extracts files from installer packages and copies them to the locations defined by the installer. The program can be used to install Microsoft software as well as third-party applications.

Description	:	
	(File Type: Data File) :: A DAT file is a generic data file. It contains data that may be opened or referenced by a specific application. While some DAT files can be opened directly, most contain program data that is referenced the program when it is running. Therefore, most DAT files are not meant to be opened manually. Since ".dat" is a generic extension, it may be used by multiple programs. This can make it difficult to know how to open a DAT file. However, if the DAT file is saved in a text format, you can view the contents of the file by opening it in a text editor.
	(File Type: VCD Video File) :: A DAT file may also be a video file from a Video CD, or VCD disc. DAT files are typically found in the \MPEGAV\ directory of VCD disks and contain MPEG video data. They can be opened directly by supporting video playback programs.
	(File Type: Exchange E-mail Attachment) :: Files named Winmail.dat contain formatting information for Rich Text (.RTF) messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange Server. A Winmail.dat file may be appended to the end of an e-mail when the recipient's e-mail client does not support RTF-formatted messages.

	(File Type: Hypertext Markup Language File) :: Runs when opened

Description	:	
	(File Type: Hypertext Markup Language File) :: An HTML file is a Web page that contains code written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). This code defines the format and content of the Web page and may include references to images and other types of media. When a user visits the Web page, the HTML code is parsed by the user's Web browser and the content of the Web page appears in the browser window. HTML files can be created with a Web development program, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, or with a basic text editor. When an HTML page is loaded by a Web browser, the browser displays the content of page, rather than the HTML itself. To view the HTML source code, you can select "View Source," which is typically located in the Web browser's View menu.

Description	:	
	(File Type: Graphical Interchange Format File) :: GIF files are saved in a compressed, indexed-color format and are commonly used for Web graphics. They use lossless compression, which means they do not lose any quality when compressed. The GIF format supports up to 256 colors (including transparent pixels), which may be predefined or selected by the user. GIFs can also be animated, making them popular choices for buttons and other small Web graphics. However, since GIF images can only contain 256 colors, they are not ideal for digital photographs. This is why most digital photos are saved as .JPG files.

	(File Type: Citrix ICA File) :: Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) file used by Citrix application servers; contains configuration information for connecting to different servers; may link to a published application or to a server desktop environment. ICA files allow users to connect to remote virtual desktops so the user's computer does not need the applications to be installed locally. This mechanism provides advantages for system administration and also allows users to access critical business applications, or "enterprise applications," from remote locations. ICA files can be created with the ICA File Creator program or a basic text editor. Important: You can double-click an ICA file to open the remote virtual application or desktop environment referenced by the file. But, note that you must have a Citrix client installed in order for the file to open properly. A common client is the Citrix Receiver, a desktop application and Web browser plug-in that runs the hosted applications and desktops within a Web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Citrix Receiver replaced the former "Citrix Online Plug-in" for Mac and Windows.

However, unless high amounts of compression are used, the quality loss is typically not noticeable. Since JPEG is a ubiquitous file format, JPG images can be viewed in all Web browsers and in most image-editing programs.

	(File Type: Zipped File) :: A ZIP file is a compressed file archive that may contain one or more files. The files are "zipped" into a single archive that takes up minimal space using a file compression algorithm. In order to open the file(s) in the archive, they must be decompressed or "unzipped" with a file decompression utility. Both Macintosh and Windows computers have built-in zip utilities that can zip and unzip files, but several third-party options are also available. About Corel WinZip WinZip is a popular file compression utility for Windows. It can be used to compress and decompress file archives in many different formats and can create split archives. WinZip supports the "ZIPX" format and also supports image compression. The program can also encrypt files with AES encryption to protect sensitive data.

	(File Type: Windows Cabinet File) :: A cabinet file stores multiple compressed files in a library. It is an efficient way to package data and is often used for creating software installation archives. Examples of installers that use cabinet files include device drivers, software updates, and network components. Developers can use cabinet creation tools such as Makecab.exe and Cabarc.exe to create cabinet files for use with a software installer. Large files can be spanned across multiple cabinets, but each cabinet can have a maximum of 15 files that span to a second cabinet file. The installation utility, such as Windows Installer, extracts the files in the same order they are stored in the cabinet file. Important: CAB files may be located inside or outside of an .MSI file. About Microsoft Windows Installer Windows Installer is a utility included with the Windows operating system for installing applications. It extracts files from installer packages and copies them to the locations defined by the installer. The program can be used to install Microsoft software as well as third-party applications. Windows Installer can also be used to remove software that has been previously installed.

Description	:	
	(File Type: Data File) :: A DAT file is a generic data file. It contains data that may be opened or referenced by a specific application. While some DAT files can be opened directly, most contain program data that is referenced the program when it is running. Therefore, most DAT files are not meant to be opened manually. Since ".dat" is a generic extension, it may be used by multiple programs. This can make it difficult to know how to open a DAT file. However, if the DAT file is saved in a text format, you can view the contents of the file by opening it in a text editor.
	(File Type: VCD Video File) :: A DAT file may also be a video file from a Video CD, or VCD disc. DAT files are typically found in the \MPEGAV\ directory of VCD disks and contain MPEG video data. They can be opened directly by supporting video playback programs.
	(File Type: Exchange E-mail Attachment) :: Files named Winmail.dat contain formatting information for Rich Text (.RTF) messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange Server. A Winmail.dat file may be appended to the end of an e-mail when the recipient's e-mail client does not support RTF-formatted messages.

	(File Type: Citrix ICA File) :: Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) file used by Citrix application servers; contains configuration information for connecting to different servers; may link to a published application or to a server desktop environment. ICA files allow users to connect to remote virtual desktops so the user's computer does not need the applications to be installed locally. This mechanism provides advantages for system administration and also allows users to access critical business applications, or "enterprise applications," from remote locations. ICA files can be created with the ICA File Creator program or a basic text editor. Important: You can double-click an ICA file to open the remote virtual application or desktop environment referenced by the file. But, note that you must have a Citrix client installed in order for the file to open properly. A common client is the Citrix Receiver, a desktop application and Web browser plug-in that runs the hosted applications and desktops within a Web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Citrix Receiver replaced the former "Citrix Online Plug-in" for Mac and Windows.

	(file type : Lite-C Script) :: N/A

Usage      	:	
	(File Type: C/C++ Source Code File) :: Runs when opened
	(File Type: Lite-C Script) :: Open manually; may run a program or script when opened

Description	:	
	(File Type: C/C++ Source Code File) :: Source code for a C or C++ program; may include an entire program's source code, or may be one of may source files referenced within a programming project; can be edited using a basic text editor, but will not show syntax highlighting like most software development programs do. C++ is the programming language used for creating many of today's software programs. Some Unix compilers use a lowercase ".c" extension for C and an upper case ".C" extension for C++, although this convention is not common.
	(File Type: Lite-C Script) :: Scripts created with lite-C also use the ".c" extension. They contain code written in the lite-C programming language and are compiled on-the-fly by the lite-C compiler. Lite-C was developed by Conitec Datasystems in cooperation with Atari. It allows users to develop 2D and 3D applications without previous programming knowledge. Many functions, images, and sounds are included with lite-C, which allows for streamlined programming. This makes lite-C an ideal solution for creating casual games and for teaching programming concepts.

Description	:	
	(File Type: Data File) :: A DAT file is a generic data file. It contains data that may be opened or referenced by a specific application. While some DAT files can be opened directly, most contain program data that is referenced the program when it is running. Therefore, most DAT files are not meant to be opened manually. Since ".dat" is a generic extension, it may be used by multiple programs. This can make it difficult to know how to open a DAT file. However, if the DAT file is saved in a text format, you can view the contents of the file by opening it in a text editor.
	(File Type: VCD Video File) :: A DAT file may also be a video file from a Video CD, or VCD disc. DAT files are typically found in the \MPEGAV\ directory of VCD disks and contain MPEG video data. They can be opened directly by supporting video playback programs.
	(File Type: Exchange E-mail Attachment) :: Files named Winmail.dat contain formatting information for Rich Text (.RTF) messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange Server. A Winmail.dat file may be appended to the end of an e-mail when the recipient's e-mail client does not support RTF-formatted messages.

Description	:	
	(File Type: Data File) :: A DAT file is a generic data file. It contains data that may be opened or referenced by a specific application. While some DAT files can be opened directly, most contain program data that is referenced the program when it is running. Therefore, most DAT files are not meant to be opened manually. Since ".dat" is a generic extension, it may be used by multiple programs. This can make it difficult to know how to open a DAT file. However, if the DAT file is saved in a text format, you can view the contents of the file by opening it in a text editor.
	(File Type: VCD Video File) :: A DAT file may also be a video file from a Video CD, or VCD disc. DAT files are typically found in the \MPEGAV\ directory of VCD disks and contain MPEG video data. They can be opened directly by supporting video playback programs.
	(File Type: Exchange E-mail Attachment) :: Files named Winmail.dat contain formatting information for Rich Text (.RTF) messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange Server. A Winmail.dat file may be appended to the end of an e-mail when the recipient's e-mail client does not support RTF-formatted messages.

	(File Type: Citrix ICA File) :: Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) file used by Citrix application servers; contains configuration information for connecting to different servers; may link to a published application or to a server desktop environment. ICA files allow users to connect to remote virtual desktops so the user's computer does not need the applications to be installed locally. This mechanism provides advantages for system administration and also allows users to access critical business applications, or "enterprise applications," from remote locations. ICA files can be created with the ICA File Creator program or a basic text editor. Important: You can double-click an ICA file to open the remote virtual application or desktop environment referenced by the file. But, note that you must have a Citrix client installed in order for the file to open properly. A common client is the Citrix Receiver, a desktop application and Web browser plug-in that runs the hosted applications and desktops within a Web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Citrix Receiver replaced the former "Citrix Online Plug-in" for Mac and Windows.
